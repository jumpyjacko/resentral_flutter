# reSentral
The (new) app for reSentral, a mobile-focused redesign and port of the Sentral school management system (student-side). This was created because of an active and burning disdain for the poor design of Sentral's web interface, especially when considering the mobile space. Additionally, the lack of 'Remember Me' functionality for login (while understandable) was also annoying.

Keep in mind that this is an app designed and programmed by a student who is a 100% self taught software developer.

## Where is it right now?
